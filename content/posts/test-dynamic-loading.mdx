# Testing Dynamic Post Loading

This post was created to demonstrate that the system automatically:

1. ✅ Reads posts dynamically from the `/content/posts/` directory
2. ✅ Uses `fs.readdirSync()` to scan for `.mdx` files
3. ✅ Processes frontmatter with `gray-matter`
4. ✅ Prevents broken links by checking file existence
5. ✅ Updates the Home page without code changes

## How It Works

The system uses these key functions:

- `getPostSlugs()` - Scans directory for `.mdx` files
- `getAllPosts()` - Loads and processes all posts
- `getFeaturedPosts()` - Filters featured posts for home page
- `getPostBySlug()` - Loads individual posts safely

## No Hardcoded Data

Everything is loaded dynamically from the file system!
